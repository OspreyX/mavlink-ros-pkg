MAVLINK to ROS BRIDGE

This ROS node allow to send and receive MAVLINK packets from either an
autopilot board, wireless link (Ground Control Station) or from the MAVCONN/LCM
middleware.

INSTALLATION:

Assuming you're familiar with ROS:

# Checkout the source code
git clone <this repository url>
# Add the folder to the ROS package list
gedit ~/.bashrc
# Add this line (ADJUST THE FOLDER!!!)
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/pixhawk/mavlink-ros-pkg:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
# Reload bash rc
source ~/.bashrc
# Change to the directory
cd mavlink-ros-pkg
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
# Use the executables in the bin directory

USE:

Two basic executables are generated:

lcmtoros and rostolcm

lcmtoros listens to lcm mavlink channel and forwards all received MAVLINK messages as special ROS MAVLINK messages (see msg definition) to the ROS mavlink channel. To receive the messages create a NodeHandle and subscribe to "mavlink". You can translate the ROS MAVLINK message back to a standard MAVLINK message by calling the function createMavlinkFromROS() defined in include/mavlinkros.h.
For a example see ros_receiver_example.cpp.

rostolcm listens to ROS mavlink channel and forwards all received ROS MAVLINK message to the lcm mavlink channel. The easiest way for a ROS node to sent a message to the lcm mavlink channel is therefore to create a MAVLINK message, fill in the fields, convert it with the function createROSFromMavlink() defined in include/mavlinkros.h and send it to the ROS channel "mavlink". rostolcm will then receive this message and forward it to the lcm channel.

RUN:

To receive MAVLINK messages inside ROS:

rosrun lcm_mavlink_ros lcmtoros

To send MAVLINK messages from ROS:

rosrun lcm_mavlink_ros rostolcm
