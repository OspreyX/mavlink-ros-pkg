IMPORTANT NOTE: PLEASE READ THE INDIVIDUAL README FILES IN THE SUBFOLDERS FOR INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS



If rosmake is run from this directory, it will attempt to compile ALL packages. This might however FAIL if you don't have all dependencies installed. It is therefore recommended to install from within individual subfolders


lcm_mavlink_ros		ROS node that communicates with the MAVCONN aerial robotics middleware
			(http://github.com/pixhawk/mavconn). MAVCONN provides computer-vision
			specific interfaces and algorithms and is very lightweight.


serial_mavlink_ros	ROS node that directly interfaces a serial port and communicates with a MAVLINK
			compatible device (i.e. APM / ACM / UDB / pxIMU) or with a radio modem (e.g. XBee)
			and a ground control station (e.g. QGroundControl or APM Planner).


mavconn_asctec		ROS node that interfaces the MAVCONN middleware to an Ascending Technologies
			multi-rotor via their Asctec-ROS interface
